This repository contains python helpers for running and manipulating Modelica models and results.
It is posted here under MIT but is not presently maintained; see instead [Mechanomy's Julia libraries](https://mechanomy.com/tags/julia/).

# ModelicaSimulate
Wraps [OMPython](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMPython) in a python class to allow higher-level Modelica model manipulation.
See OpenModelica's scripting api [here](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/scripting_api.html)

# ModelicaResult
Reads a Modelica *.mat into python variables via [DyMat](https://github.com/jraedler/DyMat).
